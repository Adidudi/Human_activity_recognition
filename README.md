In this study, I applied supervised learning models, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, 
Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree and KNN algorithm to classify 10 complex 
CrossFit exercises based on data collected from 2 smartwatches. I used grid search to find 
the optimal parameters for models and checked modelsâ€™ classification quality using 
standard performance metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. In addition,
I tackled the problem of repetition counting using peak detection recognition. For both of
these tasks, results were compared with deep learning models. The obtained results 
indicate that the neural networks perform slightly better than any of the 5 mentioned 
above models in the task of complex exercise recognition. In the task of repetition 
counting peak detection approach outperformed neural networks confirming the 
hypothesis, that methods based on handcrafted features can be more efficient and 
accurate.
